Abstract:Automatic controls play an ever-increasing role in a human way of life. Automatic control is vast technological area whose central aim is to develop control strategies that improve performance when they applied to a system. the distinct characteristic of automatic control is that it reduces the human operator. One such gadget is the fan. The fans are generally available with speed control, depending on the requirement the speed is set. Usually, when the temperature is high the fan set at high speed and at lower temperatures the fan is operated with lower speed. This is done manually using human. In this paper, an automatic control solution is suggested to control the fan speed. A circuit with LM35DZ temperature sensor, PIC16F877A microcontroller, brush less DC motor and few of electronic components is designed and implemented to control the fan speed automatically. As an additional feature LCD is used to present the temperature and the fan speed. Finally, the designed system circuit is tested in many times and performed very well.
